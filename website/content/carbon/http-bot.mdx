If you've been around Discord for a while, you've probably seen bots in various servers. These bots have been around almost since the beginning of Discord, and for the most part, they all rely on Discord's API Gateway (which runs over a websocket) for incoming events and interactions with the bot.

However, there are some downsides to this approach for some applications, mainly that the API Gateway is, by nature, not compatible with serverless applications, as it requires a websocket connection to be established. This means that you can't use it with a platform like Vercel, which is a serverless platform.

That's where HTTP bots come in. By default, Discord will send all interactions through your Gateway connection, but you can opt-in to HTTP-based interactions instead by adding a Interactions Endpoint URL to your app's settings. 

## How do HTTP bots work?

HTTP bots work by having Discord send a POST request to the Interactions Endpoint URL you set in your app's settings. This request will contain the data of the interaction, and the bot will respond with a JSON object containing the response data.

This is a bit more complicated than a normal interaction, as it requires a separate request to be sent, but it also has some advantages. For example, you can use a platform like Vercel to host your bot, and you don't need to worry about websockets or any other complicated setup.

## Advantages of HTTP

- Compatible with serverless applications and runtimes
- No need to worry about websockets
- Can be infinitely scalable through standard HTTP load balancing

## Downsides of HTTP

HTTP bots have their own set of downsides, however, and the biggest one is that they will only work with interactions (slash commands, buttons, etc), and you don't get any of the other events such as GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE or MESSAGE_CREATE.

While this does mean you don't need to worry about intents or listening to events, it does mean that if you want to make a bot that interacts with other parts of Discord without users triggering your bot themselves, you'll need to use a Gateway-based bot.

However, you can use a hybrid approach if you choose. You can have your bot use HTTP for all interactions, and use the Gateway for all other events. This way, you can still use HTTP for things like slash commands, but still have every other event that Discord gives you.
