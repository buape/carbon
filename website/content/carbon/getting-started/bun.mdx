</Files>

## Getting Started

### Installation 
First, we need to install Carbon.
<CommandTabs command="add" args={["@buape/carbon"]} platforms={["bun"]} />

### Setting up your .env

Let's start by creating your `.env` file, which will contain the secrets and tokens for your app.

```txt title=".env"
CLIENT_ID=""
PUBLIC_KEY=""
DISCORD_TOKEN=""
```

Now, you need to get your client ID, public key, and token, and fill those out there. [You can learn more about these here.](/carbon/helpful-guides/developer-portal/create-a-bot)

### Creating a Client

Now let's start your `index.ts` file. It will be the entry point for your worker, and the main file that will be executed when your worker is deployed.

First, we need to import the Carbon client.
```ts 
// Import the Carbon client
import { Client, ClientMode } from "@buape/carbon"
```

We also need to import the serve function from `bun`.
```ts
import { serve } from "bun"
```

Now, let's make our Client.
```ts
const client = new Client(
	{
		mode: ClientMode.Bun, 
		clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
		publicKey: process.env.PUBLIC_KEY, 
		token: process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN,
		port: 3000
	},
	[] // We'll add commands here later
);
```

And finally, we need to host Carbon.
```ts
serve(client.router)
```

### Adding Commands

Now that we have our client, we can start adding commands to it. Let's create a new file called `ping.ts` in the `src/commands` folder.
```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon"

export default class PingCommand extends Command {
	name = "ping"
	description = "A simple ping command"
	defer = false

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		return interaction.reply({
			content: "Pong!"
		})
	}
}
```

This is a basic command, you set the name and description, and then add a run function that will be called when the command is used.

Now, let's add this command to our client. 
```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { PingCommand } from "./commands/ping.js"
const client = new Client(
	{
		clientId: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
		publicKey: process.env.PUBLIC_KEY,
		token: process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN,
		mode: ClientMode.Bun,
		port: 3000
	},
	[new PingCommand()]
)
```

And that's it! You now have a basic Carbon bot running on Bun.
If you want to add more commands, just create more classes in the `src/commands` folder, and add them to the client in the `src/index.ts` file.

## Running

To run your bot, let's add some scripts to your `package.json` file. 


Let's also add some scripts to our `package.json` file.
```json title="package.json"
{
	// ...

	"scripts": {
		"start": "bun run index.ts"
	},

	// ...
}
```

Then you can use this command:
<CommandTabs platforms={["bun"]} multiLine command="start" args={[""]} />

This will run your bot with the environment variables from your `.env` file.

Now you'll need to setup your bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Take a look at the following cards for more information.
