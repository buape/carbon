Next.js is a great React framework for building web apps, and works great with Carbon. 

## File Structure

<Files>
	<Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
		<Folder name="discord" defaultOpen>
			<File name="route.ts" />
			<Folder name="commands" defaultOpen>
				<File name="ping.ts" />
			</Folder>
			<Folder name="deploy" defaultOpen>
				<File name="route.ts" />
			</Folder>
		</Folder>
	</Folder>
</Files>

## Getting Started

### Installation 
First, we need to install Carbon.
<CommandTabs command="add" args={["@buape/carbon"]} />

We're going to assume that you already have a working Next.js app and that it's hosted on Vercel, so we'll just add Carbon on top of it.

### Creating a Client

Now let's start your `route.ts` file. The route.ts file is where Next.js will look for your API routes, and Carbon will be running on one of those.

First, we need to import the Carbon client.
```ts 
// Import the Carbon client
import { Client, ClientMode } from "@buape/carbon"
```

Now, let's add some code to actually use Carbon. First, we will create a new Carbon client. 

```ts
const client = new Client({
	clientId: env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
	publicKey: env.DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY,
	token: env.DISCORD_TOKEN,
	mode: ClientMode.Vercel,
	redirectUrl: getBaseUrl()
}, [])
```

### Adding Commands

Now that we have our client, we can start adding commands to it. Let's create a new file called `ping.ts` in the `commands` folder.
```ts title="app/discord/commands/ping.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon"

export class PingCommand extends Command {
	name = "ping"
	description = "A simple ping command"
	defer = false

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		return interaction.reply({
			content: "Pong!"
		})
	}
}
```

This is a basic command, you set the name and description, and then add a run function that will be called when the command is used.

Now, let's add this command to our client.
```ts
const client = new Client(
	{
		clientId: env.CLIENT_ID,
		publicKey: env.PUBLIC_KEY,
		token: env.DISCORD_TOKEN,
		mode: ClientMode.Vercel
	},
	[
		new PingCommand()
	]
)
```

Finally, we need to add a way to deploy your commands to Discord. We can do this by adding a deploy route to our client.
Add this right above the `client.router.fetch` line:
```ts title="app/discord/deploy/route.ts"
import { client } from "../route"

export function GET() {
	client.deployCommands()
	return new Response(null, {
		status: 200
	})
}
```


And that's it! You now have a basic Carbon bot running on Next.js.
If you want to add more commands, just create more classes in the `commands` folder, and add them to the client in the `route.ts` file.


Now you'll need to setup your bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Take a look at the following cards for more information.
