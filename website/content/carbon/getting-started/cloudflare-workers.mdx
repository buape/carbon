Cloudflare Workers is a quick and free option for hosting your bot, and is the primary runtime that we at Buape Studios use Carbon on.

## File Structure

<Files>
	<Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
		<File name="index.ts" />
		<Folder name="commands" defaultOpen>
			<File name="ping.ts" />
		</Folder>
	</Folder>
	<File name="package.json" />
	<File name="wrangler.toml" />
</Files>

## Getting Started

### Installation 
First, we need to install Carbon, as well as Wrangler to help us deploy our worker.
<CommandTabs command="add" args={["@buape/carbon wrangler"]} />

Let's also add `@cloudflare/workers-types`, so that we can use the `ExecutionContext` type.
<CommandTabs command="add" args={["@cloudflare/workers-types -D"]} />

### Setting up your Worker

Let's start by creating your `wrangler.toml` file, which will contain the configuration for your worker.

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
name = "my-carbon-worker"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-03"
```

Now, you need to get your client ID, public key, and token. [You can learn more about these here.](/carbon/developer-portal/create-a-bot)

Let's add these to your worker:

<CommandTabs multiLine command="wrangler" executer args={["secret put CLIENT_ID", "secret put PUBLIC_KEY", "secret put DISCORD_TOKEN"]} />

After each of these commands, you'l be prompted to enter the value. 

### Creating a Client

Now let's start your `index.ts` file. It will be the entry point for your worker, and the main file that will be executed when your worker is deployed.

First, we need to import the Carbon client.
```ts 
// Import the Carbon client
import { Client, ClientMode } from "@buape/carbon"
```

We also need to get two types: we need to create a type for our environment variables that we set in the wrangler.toml file, and we need to import the `ExecutionContext` type from `@cloudflare/workers-types`.
```ts
import type { ExecutionContext } from "@cloudflare/workers-types/2023-07-01"

type Env = {
	CLIENT_ID: string
	PUBLIC_KEY: string
	DISCORD_TOKEN: string
}
```

In Cloudflare Workers, everything is exported in one object. The `fetch` function is the entry point for your worker.
```ts
export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, _env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
		// Place your code here.
	}
}
```

Now, let's add some code to actually use Carbon. First, we will create a new Carbon client. 

```ts
export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
		// Create a new Carbon client.
		const client = new Client(
			{
				// Put your client ID, public key, and token here, _env will have them from your `wrangler.toml` file.
				clientId: env.CLIENT_ID,
				publicKey: env.PUBLIC_KEY,
				token: env.DISCORD_TOKEN,
				mode: ClientMode.CloudflareWorkers
			},
			[]
		)
		// This is how you pass control from your cf worker to Carbon. Make sure you pass the ctx part as well, so that awaits work properly within Carbon.
		const response = await client.router.fetch(request, ctx)
		// Finally, return the response from Carbon.
		return response
	}
}
```

### Adding Commands

Now that we have our client, we can start adding commands to it. Let's create a new file called `ping.ts` in the `src/commands` folder.
```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon"

export default class PingCommand extends Command {
	name = "ping"
	description = "A simple ping command"
	defer = false

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		return interaction.reply({
			content: "Pong!"
		})
	}
}
```

This is a basic command, you set the name and description, and then add a run function that will be called when the command is used.

Now, let's add this command to our client.
```ts title="src/index.ts"
const client = new Client(
	{
		clientId: env.CLIENT_ID,
		publicKey: env.PUBLIC_KEY,
		token: env.DISCORD_TOKEN,
		mode: ClientMode.CloudflareWorkers
	},
	[
		new PingCommand()
	]
)
```

Finally, we need to add a way to deploy your commands to Discord. We can do this by adding a deploy route to our client.
Add this right above the `client.router.fetch` line:
```ts title="src/index.ts"
client.router.get("/deploy", () => {
	return client.deployCommands()
})
```


And that's it! You now have a basic Carbon bot running on Cloudflare Workers.
If you want to add more commands, just create more classes in the `src/commands` folder, and add them to the client in the `src/index.ts` file.

## Deploying

To deploy your bot, let's add some scripts to your `package.json` file. 



Let's also add some scripts to our `package.json` file.
```json title="package.json"
{
	// ...

	"scripts": {
		"build": "wrangler deploy",
		"tail": "wrangler tail"
	}

	// ...
}
```

Then you can use these like this:
<CommandTabs multiLine command="run" args={["build", "tail"]} />

This will push your code to Cloudflare, and deploy your worker. You can also use the `tail` command to see the logs from your worker.

Now you'll need to setup your bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Take a look at the following cards for more information.
