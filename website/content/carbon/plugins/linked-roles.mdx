Linked Roles are a handy feature of Discord that allows you to create roles that users have to meet certain criteria in order to claim those roles.

[You can read more about the feature from an admin standpoint here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10388356626711-Connections-Linked-Roles-Admins), or [from a user standpoint here.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823-Connections-Linked-Roles-Community-Members).

## Usage

Linked Roles are straightforward to use in Carbon, all you need is to already have an instance of the [`Client`](/carbon/api/classes/Client) from Carbon.

Then, create a new instance of the `LinkedRoles` class, and pass it your metadata and checkers, along with some options for the base URL and client secret and your client.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only have 5 metadata per application, and they apply across all guilds your app is in. 

### Installation

<CommandTabs command="install" args={["@buape/carbon"]} />

### Example

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { Client } from "@buape/carbon"
import { LinkedRoles } from "@buape/carbon/linked-roles"

const client = new Client({
	clientId: "12345678901234567890",
	publicKey: "c1a2f941ae8ce6d776f7704d0bb3d46b863e21fda491cdb2bdba6b8bc5fe7269",
	token: "MTA4NjEwNTYxMDUxMDE1NTg1Nw.GNt-U8.OSHy-g-5FlfESnu3Z9MEEMJLHiRthXajiXNwiE"
})

const allStaff = ["439223656200273932"]

const linkedRoles = new LinkedRoles(client, {
	clientSecret: "Bb7aZcvRN-BhrhY2qrUO6QzOK4SeqonG",
	baseUrl: "https://example.com",
	metadata: [
		{
			key: "is_staff",
			name: "Verified Staff",
			description: "Whether the user is a verified staff member",
			type: ApplicationRoleConnectionMetadataType.BooleanEqual
		},
	],
	metadataCheckers: {
		is_staff: async (userId) => {
			if (allStaff.includes(userId)) return true
			return false
		}
	}
})
```

Once you have your `LinkedRoles` instance, you need to set it on Discord so that users will use it for linked roles.
[You can see where to add this by clicking here](/carbon/developer-portal/urls), and set the linked role to `<BASE_URL>/connect`, so for example, `https://my-carbon-worker.YOURNAME.workers.dev/connect`.
You'll also need to add a redirect URL to your Discord application, so that users can be redirected to your website after they login.
You can go to the OAuth tab on the dashboard and add a redirect URL there of `<BASE_URL>/connect/callback`, so for example, `https://my-carbon-worker.YOURNAME.workers.dev/connect/callback`.
