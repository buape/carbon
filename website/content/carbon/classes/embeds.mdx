Embeds are used to display rich content in messages. They are created by extending the [`Embed`](/carbon/api/classes/Embed) class, and adding a `title`, `description`, and `url` property.

```ts title="src/components/embed.ts"
class Embed extends Embed {
	title = "Embed Test"
	description = "This is an embed test"
	url = "https://buape.com"
}
```

Here we have created an embed with a title, description, and URL. You can use this embed in a message by using the [`Embed`](/carbon/api/classes/Embed) class.

## Example Embed
Here is an example embed with all the properties you can use.
```ts
class E extends Embed {
	title = "Embed Test"
	description = "This is an embed test"
	url = "https://buape.com"
	timestamp = new Date().toString()
	color = 16711680
	footer = {
		text: "Footer Text",
		icon: "https://cdn.buape.com/CarbonWordmark.png"
	}
	image = "https://cdn.buape.com/CarbonWordmark.png"
	thumbnail = "https://cdn.buape.com/CarbonWordmark.png"
	author = {
		name: "Author Name",
		icon: "https://buape.com"
	}
	fields = [
		{
			name: "Field 1",
			value: "Value 1",
			inline: true
		},
		{
			name: "Field 2",
			value: "Value 2",
			inline: true
		}
	]
}
```
