Modals are popup forms that can be used to collect user input. They are created by extending the [`Modal`](/carbon/api/classes/Modal) class, and adding a `title` and `components` property. All the components must be [`TextInput`](/carbon/classes/TextInput) classes.

```ts title="src/commands/modal.ts"
class ModalCommand extends Modal {
	title = "Test Modal"
	customId = "test-modal"

	components = [
		new Row([new TextInputHi()]),
		new Row([new TextInputAge()])
	]

	run(interaction: ModalInteraction) {
		return interaction.reply({
			content: `Hi ${interaction.fields.getText("name")}, you are ${interaction.fields.getText("age")} years old, and your favorite color is ${interaction.fields.getText("color")}. You are ${interaction.fields.getText("height") || "not"} tall.`
		})
	}
}
class TextInputHi extends TextInput {
	label = "Tell me about your life"
	customId = "life"
	style = TextInputStyle.Paragraph
}

class TextInputAge extends TextInput {
	label = "How old are you?"
	customId = "age"
	style = TextInputStyle.Short
}
```
