Components are used to create interactive elements in your bot, such as buttons, select menus, and text inputs.

When you create a component, you will need to pass it to the [`components` property of the `Command` class](/carbon/api/classes/CommandInteraction#properties). This will allow it to be registered with the bot as a handler.
