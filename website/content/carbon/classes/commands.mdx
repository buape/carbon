Commands are the main way to interact with your bot. They are used to handle user input and respond to it.

## Creating a Command

To create a command, you need to create a class that extends the `Command` class. This class will handle the command and its functionality.


```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon"

export default class PingCommand extends Command {
	name = "ping"
	description = "A simple ping command"

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		return interaction.reply({
			content: "Pong!"
		})
	}
}
```

In this example, we have created a simple command that responds with "Pong" when the user runs the command.

### Setting the Name and Description

The `name` and `description` properties are used to set the name and description of the command. These are used in the help command and in the command list.

### Setting the Type

The `type` property is used to set the type of the command. This is used to determine which type of command it is. The available types are:

- `ChatInput`: This is a command that can be used in a chat input.
- `User`: This is a command that can be used in a user context.
- `Message`: This is a command that can be used in a message context.

### Options

The `options` property is used to set the options of the command. These are only used for chat input commands.

- `String`: Basic string input
- `Integer`: Integer input
- `Number`: Number input
- `Boolean`: Boolean input (with autocomplete to show True and False) 
- `User`: User object (with autocomplete to show users in the server. Also accepts just an ID which will be resolved to a user object)
- `Channel`: Channel object (with autocomplete to show channels in the server. Also accepts just an ID which will be resolved to a channel object)
- `Role`: Role object (with autocomplete to show roles in the server. Also accepts just an ID which will be resolved to a role object)
- `Mentionable`: Mentionable object (with autocomplete to show both users and roles in the server)
- `Attachment`: File attachment

### Adding your Components

The `components` property is used to set the components of the command. You need to pass every component that you might use in the command, and they will be automatically registered.

[See this page for more information about components.](/carbon/classes/components)

### Automatic Defer

The `defer` property is used to set whether the command should be deferred automatically. When a command is deferred, it will show a Loading state to the user, and you have 15 minutes to reply after that.
