title: Setting URLs
---

The [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) is the main place that you can manage your bot on Discord.

## Setting your interaction URL

Once you have Carbon running, you'll want to set your interaction URL. This is the URL that Discord will send interactions to.
Unless you've modified it, this will be at `https://DOMAIN.COM/interaction`, replacing `DOMAIN.COM` with your domain.

Go to the Information tab on the left panel for your bot, and look below the public key.

Put your interaction URL in the Interaction URL field, and click Save Changes.
Discord will then attempt to send a test interaction to your URL, and if it succeeds, you're good to go!
If not, make sure you've set the URL correctly, and make sure that Carbon is actually running.
