title: Replying vs Deferring vs Acknowledging
---

In the Discord interaction system, there are 3 ways to respond to an interaction: 

## 1. Replying

This is the simplest way to respond to an interaction, and is used for most commands. It is done by using the `reply` method on the `CommandInteraction` class.

```ts
async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
	await interaction.reply({ content: "Hello world" })
}
```

## 2. Deferring

Deferring is used when you need more time to process an interaction. When you defer an interaction, the bot will send a loading state to the user. You then have up to 15 minutes to reply to the interaction afterwards, using the normal [reply](#replying) method.

<Callout title="Time Limit" type="warning">
	Deferring an interaction must be `await`ed! If you don't respond within 15 minutes, the interaction will show an error as if you never replied in the first place.
</Callout>

```ts
async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
	await interaction.defer()
	await interaction.reply({ content: "Hello world" })
}
```

## 3. Acknowledging

Acknowledging is used when you want to acknowledge an interaction, but you don't want to reply to it. You can only use this for component-based interactions.
This is useful for things such as a game bot where you want to trigger an action and then only edit the original message. 

```ts
async run(interaction: ButtonInteraction) {
	await interaction.acknowledge()
}
```
