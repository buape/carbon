The [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) is the main place that you can manage your bot on Discord.

## Creating a Bot

To create a Discord bot, you'll need to head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application by using the New Application button in the top left. Give your application a name and click Create.

You should now see a page that shows information about your bot. You can add an avatar and bio for your bot here.

You'll also want to copy the Client ID and the Public Key there, you'll need those for your application.

Once you've saved your changes, click on the Bot tab on the left panel.

After you open the bot tab, you should see a blue button that says Reset Token. Click on it and confirm that you want to reset your bot's token. You should now see a new section called Token with a button that says Copy. When we ask you to paste your bot's token somewhere, this is the value that you need to put in.

Tokens are in the format similar to this one: 
```
MTA4NjEwNTYxMDUxMDE1NTg1Nw.GNt-U8.OSHy-g-5FlfESnu3Z9MEEMJLHiRthXajiXNwiE
``` 

If you accidentally leak your bot's token or lose it, you need to come back to this page and reset your bot's token again which will reveal the new token, invalidating all old ones.
