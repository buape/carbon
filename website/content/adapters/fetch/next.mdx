### Manual Setup

This is a continuation of the [Basic Setup](/getting-started/basic-setup) guide. If you haven't already, make sure to follow the steps in the guide before proceeding.

### Move Handle File

Ensure the file where you export your handler is placed at `src/app/api/discord/[...slug]/route.ts`. The catch all slug is necessary for handling each of the routes Carbon creates.
</Step>

<Step>
### Create a Handler

Using the `@buape/carbon/adapters/fetch` package, you can create a handler that you can then export for Next.js API routes. This will handle incoming interactions and route them to your bot.

```ts
import { createHandler } from '@buape/carbon/adapters/fetch'

const client = new Client( ... )

const handler = createHandler(client)
export { handler as GET, handler as POST }
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Running in Development

<Steps>
<Step>
### Start a Proxy

Discord requires a public URL to route interactions to your project. To achieve this, you'll need to set up a proxy. The simplest way to do this is by using [`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel). This created public URL will be referred to as `PUBLIC_URL` in the following steps.

<PackageManager.Run executor scripts={["localtunnel"]} />

<Callout type="info">
You can use the `--subdomain` flag to specify a custom subdomain for your proxy.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Set Environment Variables

First things first, you'll need to grab your Discord application's secrets from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and paste them in your `.env.local` file.

<Callout type="warn">
`BASE_URL` should be your public URL **plus the relative path** to your Next.js API routes, likely `/api/discord`.
You can rename this variable if it conflicts with your existing environment variables.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Portal URLs

Now that you have a public URL, navigate back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and set the "Interactions Endpoint URL" to `<BASE_URL>/interactions`.

</Step>

<Step>
### Invite your App

You'll need to invite your app to your server to interact with it. To do so, navigate to the Installation tab of your app in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

</Step>

<Step>
### Run the Bot

You can now run your bot using:

<PackageManager.Run scripts={["dev"]} />
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Your Commands to Discord

Finally, to deploy your commands to Discord, navigate to `<BASE_URL>/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>` in your browser. This will send your command data to Discord to register them with your bot.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Deploying to Production

Your new app can be deployed anywhere you can run a Next.js app. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying). Once you do have a deployment, remember to [configure your portal URLs](#configuring-portal-urls) to the URL of your running app.

<Callout type="info">
Remember to deploy your commands to Discord using `<BASE_URL>/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>`.
