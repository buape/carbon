## Manual Setup

This is a continuation of the [Basic Setup](/getting-started/basic-setup) guide. If you haven't already, make sure to follow the steps in the guide before proceeding.

<Step>
### Create a Fetch Handler

Using the `@buape/carbon/adapters/cloudflare` package, you can create a handler that you can then export for Cloudflare Workers. This server will handle incoming interactions and route them to your bot.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { createHandler } from '@buape/carbon/adapters/fetch'

const client = new Client( ... )

const handler = createHandler(client)
export default { fetch: handler }
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create a Entry Point File

To access environment variables globally in a Cloudflare Worker, Carbon uses a workaround by assigning the `process.env` object to the `globalThis` object before importing the main handler file. This approach allows you to access environment variables at the top level of your handler file, something that is not normally possible in Cloudflare Workers.

```ts title="src/entry.ts"
import type { ExecutionContext } from '@cloudflare/workers-types'

export default {
  fetch(req: Request, env: Record<string, string>, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
		Reflect.set(globalThis, 'process', { env })
		const handle = await import('./index.js')
		return handle.default.fetch(req, ctx)
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Add a Wrangler Configuration

You'll need to create a `wrangler.toml` file in the root of your project to configure your Cloudflare Worker to use the entry point file you created. This file should look something like this:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
name = " ... "
main = "src/entry.ts"
compatibility_date = " ... "
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Running in Development

<Steps>
<Step>
### Start a Proxy

Discord requires a public URL to route interactions to your project. To achieve this, you'll need to set up a proxy. The simplest way to do this is by using [`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel). This created public URL will be referred to as `PUBLIC_URL` in the following steps.

<PackageManager.Run executor scripts={["localtunnel"]} />

<Callout type="info">
You can use the `--subdomain` flag to specify a custom subdomain for your proxy.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Set Environment Variables

First things first, you'll need to grab your Discord application's secrets from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and paste them in your `.dev.vars` file.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Portal URLs

Now that you have a public URL, navigate back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and set the "Interactions Endpoint URL" to `<BASE_URL>/interactions`.

</Step>

<Step>
### Invite your App

You'll need to invite your app to your server to interact with it. To do so, navigate to the Installation tab of your app in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

</Step>

<Step>
### Run the Bot

You can now run your bot using:

<PackageManager.Run scripts={["dev"]} />
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Your Commands to Discord

Finally, to deploy your commands to Discord, navigate to `<BASE_URL>/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>` in your browser. This will send your command data to Discord to register them with your bot.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Deploying to Production

<Steps>
<Step>
### Prepare Environment

Before deploying your bot, you'll need to set your environment variables. This can be done using the Wrangler CLI.

<PackageManager.Run
    executor
    scripts={[
        "wrangler secret put BASE_URL",
        "wrangler secret put DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY",
        "wrangler secret put DISCORD_CLIENT_ID",
        "wrangler secret put DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
    ]}
/>

<Callout type="info">
Remember to [configure your portal URLs](#configuring-portal-urls) to the URL of your Cloudflare Worker.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy to Cloudflare

Once you've set your environment variables, you can deploy your bot with the following command:

<PackageManager.Run executor scripts={["wrangler deploy"]} />
</Step>

<Callout type="info">
Remember to deploy your commands to Discord using `<BASE_URL>/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>`.
</Callout>

</Steps>
