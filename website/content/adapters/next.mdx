### Manual Setup

This is a continuation of the [Basic Setup](/getting-started/basic-setup) guide. If you haven't already, make sure to follow the steps in the guide before proceeding.

### Create a Handler

Using the `@buape/carbon/adapters/next` package, you can create a handler that you can then export for Next.js API routes. This server will handle incoming interactions and route them to your bot.

```ts
import { createHandler } from '@buape/carbon/adapters/next'

const handle = createHandle( ... )

const handler = createHandler(handle)
export { handler as GET, handler as POST }
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Running in Development

<Steps>
<Step>
### Set Environment Variables

First things first, you'll need to grab your Discord application's secrets from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and paste them in your `.env.local` file.

</Step>

<Step>
### Start a Proxy

Discord requires a public URL to route interactions to your project. To achieve this, you'll need to set up a proxy. The simplest way to do this is by using [`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel). Once you have the public URL, set it as `BASE_URL="<PUBLIC_URL>/api/discord"` in your `.env.local` file.

<PackageManager.Run executor scripts={["localtunnel"]} />

<Callout type="info">
You can use the `--subdomain` flag to specify a custom subdomain for your proxy.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Portal URLs

Now that you have a public URL, navigate back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and set the "Interactions Endpoint URL" to `<BASE_URL>/interactions`.

<Callout type="warn">
`<BASE_URL>` refers to the public URL plus the relative path to your Next.js API routes, likely `/api/discord`.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Invite your App

You'll need to invite your app to your server to interact with it. To do so, navigate to the Installation tab of your app in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

</Step>

<Step>
### Run the Bot

You can now run your bot using:

<PackageManager.Run scripts={["dev"]} />
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Your Commands to Discord

Finally, to deploy your commands to Discord, navigate to `<BASE_URL>/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>` in your browser. This will send your command data to Discord to register them with your bot.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Deploying to Production

Your new app can be deployed anywhere you can run a Next.js app. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying). Once you do have a deployment, remember to [configure your portal URLs](#configuring-portal-urls) to the URL of your running app.

<Callout type="info">
Remember to deploy your commands to Discord using `<BASE_URL>/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>`.
