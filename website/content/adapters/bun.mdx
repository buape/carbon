## Manual Setup

This is a continuation of the [Basic Setup](/getting-started/basic-setup) guide. If you haven't already, make sure to follow the steps in the guide before proceeding.

<Step>
### Create a Server

Using the `@buape/carbon/adapters/bun` package, you can create a server to host your bot. This server will handle incoming interactions and route them to your bot.

```ts
import { createServer } from '@buape/carbon/adapters/bun'

const client = new Client( ... )

createServer(client, { port: 3000 })
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Running in Development

<Steps>
<Step>
### Set Environment Variables

First things first, you'll need to grab your Discord application's secrets from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and paste them in your `.env` file.

</Step>

<Step>
### Set Up a Proxy

Discord requires a public URL to route interactions to your project. To achieve this, you'll need to set up a proxy. The simplest way to do this is by using [`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel). Once you have the public URL, you may want to set it as `BASE_URL="<PUBLIC_URL>"` in your `.env` file.

<PackageManager.Run executor scripts={["localtunnel"]} />

<Callout type="info">
You can use the `--subdomain` flag to specify a custom subdomain for your proxy.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Portal URLs

Now that you have a public URL, navigate back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and set the "Interactions Endpoint URL" to `<BASE_URL>/interactions`.

</Step>

<Step>
### Invite your App

You'll need to invite your app to your server to interact with it. To do so, navigate to the Installation tab of your app in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

</Step>

<Step>
### Run the Bot

You can now run your bot using:

<PackageManager.Run scripts={["dev"]} />
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Your Commands to Discord

Finally, to deploy your commands to Discord, navigate to `<BASE_URL>/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>` in your browser. This will send your command data to Discord to register them with your bot.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Deploying to Production

<Steps>
<Step>
### Prepare a Server

Since you're deploying a Bun project, you'll need a server to host your bot. You'll also need to set up [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your server.

</Step>

<Step>
### Initialize a Git Repository

You'll need to transfer your project files to your server, this can be done using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). To do this, initialize a new Git repository, commit your files and push them to GitHub. On your server you can then clone your repository.

<Callout type="warn">
Make sure not to commit your `.env` file or any secrets to your repository.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Prepare Environment

Almost there! Now just like in development, you'll need to set up a proxy, configure your environment variables and set up your Discord app's URLs. Additionally, you'll need to install your dependencies using:

<PackageManager.Install packages={[]} />
</Step>

<Step>
### Start the Bot

Now that you've prepared your environment, you can finally build and start your bot using:

<PackageManager.Run scripts={["build", "start"]} />

You may also want to set up a process manager like [PM2](https://npmjs.com/package/pm2) to keep your bot running in the background.

</Step>

<Callout type="info">
Remember to deploy your commands to Discord using `<BASE_URL>/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>`.
</Callout>

</Steps>
