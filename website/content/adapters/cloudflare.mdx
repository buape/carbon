### Manual Setup

This is a continuation of the [Basic Setup](/getting-started/basic-setup) guide. If you haven't already, make sure to follow the steps in the guide before proceeding.

### Create a Handler

Using the `@buape/carbon/adapters/cloudflare` package, you can create a handler that you can then export for Cloudflare Workers. This server will handle incoming interactions and route them to your bot.

```ts
import { createHandler } from '@buape/carbon/adapters/cloudflare'

const handle = createHandle( ... )

const handler = createHandler(handle)
export default { fetch: handler }
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Running in Development

<Steps>
<Step>
### Set Environment Variables

First things first, you'll need to grab your Discord application's secrets from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and paste them in your `.dev.vars` file.

</Step>

<Step>
### Start a Proxy

Discord requires a public URL to route interactions to your project. To achieve this, you'll need to set up a proxy. The simplest way to do this is by using [`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel). Once you have the public URL, set it as `BASE_URL="<PUBLIC_URL>"` in your `.dev.vars` file.

<PackageManager.Run executor scripts={["localtunnel"]} />

<Callout type="info">
You can use the `--subdomain` flag to specify a custom subdomain for your proxy.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Portal URLs

Now that you have a public URL, navigate back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and set the "Interactions Endpoint URL" to `<BASE_URL>/interactions`.

</Step>

<Step>
### Invite your App

You'll need to invite your app to your server to interact with it. To do so, navigate to the Installation tab of your app in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

</Step>

<Step>
### Run the Bot

You can now run your bot using:

<PackageManager.Run scripts={["dev"]} />
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Your Commands to Discord

Finally, to deploy your commands to Discord, navigate to `<BASE_URL>/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>` in your browser. This will send your command data to Discord to register them with your bot.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Deploying to Production

<Steps>
<Step>
### Prepare Environment

Before deploying your bot, you'll need to set your environment variables. This can be done using the Wrangler CLI.

<PackageManager.Run
    executor
    scripts={[
        "wrangler secret put BASE_URL # e.g. https://<PROJECT_NAME>.<ACCOUNT_NAME>.workers.dev",
        "wrangler secret put DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY",
        "wrangler secret put DISCORD_CLIENT_ID",
        "wrangler secret put DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET",
        "wrangler secret put DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
    ]}
/>

<Callout type="info">
Remember to [configure your portal URLs](#configuring-portal-urls) to the URL of your Cloudflare Worker.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy to Cloudflare

Once you've set your environment variables, you can deploy your bot with the following command:

<PackageManager.Run executor scripts={["wrangler deploy"]} />
</Step>

<Callout type="info">
Remember to deploy your commands to Discord using `<BASE_URL>/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>`.
</Callout>

</Steps>
