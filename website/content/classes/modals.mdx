Modals are popup forms that can be used to collect user input. They are created by extending the [`Modal`](/api/index/classes/Modal) class, and adding a `title` and `components` property. All the components must be [`TextInput`](/api/index/classes/TextInput) classes.

Modals are automatically registered when they are shown to a user. The registration happens when you call `showModal` on an interaction.

```ts title="src/commands/modal.ts"
import { 
	Command, 
	type CommandInteraction, 
	type ComponentData, 
	type Modal, 
	type ModalInteraction, 
	Row, 
	TextInput, 
	TextInputStyle
} from "@buape/carbon"

export default class ModalCommand extends Command {
	name = "modal"
	description = "A command that shows a modal"

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		await interaction.showModal(new TestModal())
	}
}

class TestModal extends Modal {
	title = "Test Modal"
	customId = "test-modal:action=submit"

	components = [
		new Row([new TextInputName()]),
		new Row([new TextInputAge()])
	]

	async run(interaction: ModalInteraction, data: ComponentData) {
		const name = interaction.fields.getText("name")
		const age = interaction.fields.getText("age")
		await interaction.reply(
			`Hi ${name}, you are ${age} years old!`
		)
	}
}

class TextInputName extends TextInput {
	label = "What is your name?"
	customId = "name"
	style = TextInputStyle.Short
}

class TextInputAge extends TextInput {
	label = "How old are you?"
	customId = "age"
	style = TextInputStyle.Short
}
```

## Custom ID System

Modals use the same custom ID system as components, allowing you to pass data along with the modal. The format is:

```
key:arg1=value1;arg2=value2
```

For example, if you have a modal that needs to know which user to edit, you could do:

```ts
class EditUserModal extends Modal {
	title = "Edit User"
	customId = "edit-user:userId=123456789"

	components = [
		new Row([new TextInputName()])
	]

	async run(interaction: ModalInteraction) {
		const { userId } = interaction.customIdParser(interaction.customId).data
		const name = interaction.fields.getText("name")
		// Edit user with ID userId to have name name
	}
}
```

The custom ID parser will automatically convert:
- `true` and `false` to booleans
- Numbers to numbers
- Everything else to strings

You can also override the `customIdParser` method if you want to use a different format for your custom IDs.
