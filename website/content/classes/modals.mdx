Modals are popup forms that can be used to collect user input. They are created by extending the [`Modal`](/api/index/classes/Modal) class, and adding a `title` and `components` property. All the components must be [`TextInput`](/api/index/classes/TextInput) classes.

```ts title="src/commands/modal.ts"
class ModalCommand extends Modal {
    title = "Test Modal"
    customId = "test-modal"

	components = [
		new Row([new TextInputHi()]),
		new Row([new TextInputAge()])
	]

    async run(interaction: ModalInteraction) {
        const name = interaction.fields.getText("name")
        const age = interaction.fields.getText("age")
        const color = interaction.fields.getText("color")
        const height = interaction.fields.getText("height") || "not";
        await interaction.reply(
            `Hi ${name}, you are ${age} years old, and your favorite color is ${color}. You are ${height} tall.`
        )
    }
}

class TextInputHi extends TextInput {
    label = "Tell me about your life"
    customId = "life"
    style = TextInputStyle.Paragraph
}

class TextInputAge extends TextInput {
    label = "How old are you?"
    customId = "age"
    style = TextInputStyle.Short
}
```
