The main class that is used to use Carbon is the [`Client`](/api/index/classes/Client) class. Everything all connects to this one class, and it is the main instance for your bot.

## Creating a Client

```ts title="src/index.ts"
const client = new Client({
    baseUrl: " ... ",
    deploySecret: " ... ",
    clientId: " ... ",
    publicKey: " ... ",
    token: " ... ",
}, [new PingCommand()])
```

Here we have created a client with the following options:

- `baseUrl`: The relative base URL of your app
- `deploySecret`: The deploy secret of your bot, used as a password for deploying commands and other sensitive matters
- `clientId`: The Discord client ID of your bot
- `publicKey`: The Discord public key of your bot
- `token`: The Discord token of your bot

And we have also provided it with a list of commands, which in this case is just the `PingCommand` we created earlier.
