The main class that is used to use Carbon is the [`Client`](/api/index/classes/Client) class. Everything all connects to this one class, and it is the main instance for your bot.

## Creating a Client

A client must be created within your [`createHandle`](/api/index/functions/createHandle) factory. 

```ts title="src/index.ts"
const handle = createHandle((env) => {
    const client = new Client({
        baseUrl: String(env.BASE_URL),
        deploySecret: String(env.DEPLOY_SECRET),
        clientId: String(env.CLIENT_ID),
        clientSecret: String(env.CLIENT_SECRET),
        publicKey: String(env.PUBLIC_KEY),
        token: String(env.TOKEN),
    }, [new PingCommand()])
    return [client]
})
```

Here we have created a client with the following options:

- `baseUrl`: The base URL of your bot, relative to your public URL
- `deploySecret`: The deploy secret of your bot, used as a password for deploying commands and other sensitive matters
- `clientId`: The Discord client ID of your bot
- `clientSecret`: The Discord client secret of your bot
- `publicKey`: The Discord public key of your bot
- `token`: The Discord token of your bot

And we have also provided it with a list of commands, which in this case is just the `PingCommand` we created earlier.
