The main class that is used to use Carbon is the [`Client`](/api/index/classes/Client) class. Everything all connects to this one class, and it is the main instance for your bot.

## Creating a Client

```ts title="src/index.ts"
const client = new Client({
    baseUrl: " ... ",
    deploySecret: " ... ",
    clientId: " ... ",
    publicKey: " ... ",
    token: " ... ",
}, [new PingCommand()])
```

Here we have created a client with the following options:

- `baseUrl`: The relative base URL of your app
- `deploySecret`: The deploy secret of your bot, used as a password for deploying commands and other sensitive matters
- `clientId`: The Discord client ID of your bot
- `publicKey`: The Discord public key of your bot
- `token`: The Discord token of your bot

And we have also provided it with a list of commands, which in this case is just the `PingCommand` we created earlier.

## Using Caching

Carbon provides built-in caching support through the `ClientWithCaching` class. This class extends the base `Client` class and adds caching capabilities for various Discord entities.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
const client = new ClientWithCaching({
    baseUrl: " ... ",
    deploySecret: " ... ",
    clientId: " ... ",
    publicKey: " ... ",
    token: " ... ",
    caching: {
        ttl: 300000, // 5 minutes
        cleanupInterval: 600000 // 10 minutes
    }
}, [new PingCommand()])
```

The caching options include:

- `ttl`: Time in milliseconds after which cache entries expire (default: 300000 - 5 minutes)
- `cleanupInterval`: Time in milliseconds between automatic cache cleanup runs (default: 600000 - 10 minutes)

You can also provide a custom cache instance for integration with other caching setups such as redis:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
const customCache = new Cache({
    ttl: 600000, // 10 minutes
    cleanupInterval: 1200000 // 20 minutes
})

const client = new ClientWithCaching({
    // ... other options ...
    customCache
})
```

### Cache Methods

The `ClientWithCaching` class provides several methods for managing the cache:

```ts
// Purge cache entries based on filters
client.purgeCache({
    type: "user", // Optional: specific cache type to purge
    before: Date.now() - 3600000, // Optional: purge entries older than 1 hour
    after: Date.now() - 1800000 // Optional: purge entries newer than 30 minutes
})

// Clear entire cache or specific type
client.clearCache() // Clear all cache
client.clearCache("user") // Clear only user cache
```

### Bypassing Cache

All fetch methods support an optional `bypassCache` parameter to skip the cache:

```ts
// This will always fetch from Discord API, ignoring cache
const user = await client.fetchUser("123456789", true)
```
