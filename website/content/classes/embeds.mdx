Embeds are used to display rich content in messages. They are created by extending the [`Embed`](/api/index/classes/Embed) class, and adding a `title`, `description`, and `url` property.

```ts
class TestEmbed extends Embed {
    title = "Embed Test";
    description = "This is an embed test";
    url = "https://buape.com";
}
```

Here we have created an embed with a title, description, and URL. You can use this embed in a message by using the [`Embed`](/api/index/classes/Embed) class.

## Example Embed

Here is an example embed with all the properties you can use:

```ts
class TestEmbed extends Embed {
    title = "Embed Test"
    description = "This is an embed test"
    url = "https://carbon.buape.com"
    timestamp = new Date().toString()
    color = 16711680;
    footer = {
        text: "Footer Text",
        icon: "https://cdn.buape.com/CarbonWordmark.png",
    };
    image = "https://cdn.buape.com/CarbonWordmark.png";
    thumbnail = "https://cdn.buape.com/CarbonWordmark.png";
    author = {
        name: "Author Name",
        icon: "https://buape.com",
    };
    fields = [
        {
            name: "Field 1",
            value: "Value 1",
            inline: true,
        },
        {
            name: "Field 2",
            value: "Value 2",
            inline: true,
        },
    ];
}
```
