Commands are the main way to interact with your bot. They are used to handle user input and respond to it.

## Creating a Command

To create a command, you need to create a class that extends the [`Command`](/api/index/classes/Command) class. This class will handle the command and its functionality.

```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";

export default class PingCommand extends Command {
    name = "ping"
    description = "A simple ping command"

    async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
        await interaction.reply("Pong!")
    }
}
```

In this example, we have created a simple command that responds with "Pong" when the user runs the command.

### Setting the Name and Description

The `name` and `description` properties are used to set the name and description of the command. These are used in the help command and in the command list.

### Setting the Type

The `type` property is used to set the type of the command. This is used to determine which type of command it is. The available types are:

-   `ChatInput`: This is a command that can be used in a chat input.
-   `User`: This is a command that can be used in a user context.
-   `Message`: This is a command that can be used in a message context.

### Options

The `options` property is used to set the options of the command. These are only used for chat input commands.

-   `String`: Basic string input
-   `Integer`: Integer input
-   `Number`: Number input
-   `Boolean`: Boolean input (with autocomplete to show True and False)
-   `User`: User object (with autocomplete to show users in the server. Also accepts just an ID which will be resolved to a user object)
-   `Channel`: Channel object (with autocomplete to show channels in the server. Also accepts just an ID which will be resolved to a channel object)
-   `Role`: Role object (with autocomplete to show roles in the server. Also accepts just an ID which will be resolved to a role object)
-   `Mentionable`: Mentionable object (with autocomplete to show both users and roles in the server)
-   `Attachment`: File attachment

### Adding your Components

The `components` property is used to set the components of the command. You need to pass every component that you might use in the command, and they will be automatically registered.

[See this page for more information about components.](/classes/components)

### Automatic Defer

The `defer` property is used to set whether the command should be deferred automatically. When a command is deferred, it will show a Loading state to the user, and you have 15 minutes to reply after that.

## Wildcard Commands

You can also create a wildcard command, which will be called when no command is found. This is useful for when you want to have a default command that is called when no other command is found, or for something like a maintenance mode for another bot that you can switch to.

To create a wildcard command, you just have to create a command like normal, but set the name to `"*"`. This will be called when no other command is found.

```ts title="src/commands/_maintenance.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";

export default class MaintenanceCommand extends Command {
    name = "*"
    description = "Maintenance mode"
    defer = false

    async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
        await interaction.reply(
            "The bot is currently under maintenance. Please try again later."
        )
    }
}
```
