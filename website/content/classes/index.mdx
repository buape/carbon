Carbon is built upon many sets of classes, that you will extend in your own code, including commands, components, and the Carbon client itself.

Each of these classes has a set of properties on the class itself that you can set, as well as methods that Carbon will call, such as [Command#run](/carbon/api/index/classes/Command#run).
