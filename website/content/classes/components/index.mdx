Components are used to create interactive elements in your bot, such as buttons, select menus, and text inputs.

When you create a component, you will need to pass it to the [`components` property of the `Command` class](/api/classes/CommandInteraction#properties). This will allow it to be registered with the bot as a handler.
When you pass it, make sure you aren't instantiating it, but rather just passing the class itself.

```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon"

export default class PingCommand extends Command {
	name = "ping"
	description = "A simple ping command"
	defer = false

	components = [PingButton]

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		return interaction.reply({
			content: "Pong!"
		})
	}
}

class PingButton extends Button {
	customId = "ping"
	label = "Ping"
	style = ButtonStyle.Primary

	async run(interaction: ButtonInteraction) {
		return interaction.reply({
			content: "OMG YOU CLICKED THE BUTTON"
		})
	}
}
```

If you don't want to automatically register the components, you can do so manually by setting the `autoRegister` option to `false` in the client options.
