Components are used to create interactive elements in your bot, such as buttons, select menus, and text inputs.

Components are automatically registered when they are used in a message. The registration happens when you use the component in a message, either through `reply`, `followUp`, or any other method that sends a message with components.

```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon"

export default class PingCommand extends Command {
	name = "ping"
	description = "A simple ping command"
	defer = false

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		return interaction.reply({
			content: "Pong!",
			components: [new Row([new PingButton()])]
		})
	}
}

class PingButton extends Button {
	customId = "ping:action=click"
	label = "Ping"
	style = ButtonStyle.Primary

	async run(interaction: ButtonInteraction) {
		return interaction.reply({
			content: "OMG YOU CLICKED THE BUTTON"
		})
	}
}
```

## Custom ID System

Components use a custom ID system that allows you to pass data along with the component. The format is:

```
key:arg1=value1;arg2=value2
```

For example, if you have a button that needs to know which user to ping, you could do:

```ts
class PingButton extends Button {
	customId = "ping:userId=123456789"
	label = "Ping User"
	style = ButtonStyle.Primary

	async run(interaction: ButtonInteraction) {
		const { userId } = interaction.customIdParser(interaction.customId).data
		return interaction.reply({
			content: `Pinging user ${userId}`
		})
	}
}
```

The custom ID parser will automatically convert:
- `true` and `false` to booleans
- Numbers to numbers
- Everything else to strings

You can also override the `customIdParser` method if you want to use a different format for your custom IDs.
