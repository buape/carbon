Text Inputs are blank text fields used solely within [Modals](/api/classes/modals) to collect user input. They are created by extending the `TextInput` class, and adding a `label` and `placeholder` property.

```ts title="src/components/text-input.ts"
class TextInputHi extends TextInput {
	label = "Tell me about your life"
	customId = "life"
	style = TextInputStyle.Paragraph
}

class TextInputAge extends TextInput {
	label = "How old are you?"
	customId = "age"
	style = TextInputStyle.Short
}
```

Here we have 2 examples of text inputs, one in a large paragraph form, and one in a short form.
