The Section component helps organize related information in a horizontal layout. It can contain multiple components (typically text) and optionally include an accessory element like a thumbnail that appears alongside the main content.

## Component Structure

A Section is defined by its ability to display components horizontally and optionally include an accessory component. It's commonly used to pair text with related media or icons.

## Creating a Section

To create a section, you need to create a class that extends the `Section` class:

```ts title="src/components/section.ts"
import { Section, TextDisplay, Thumbnail } from "@buape/carbon";

class MySection extends Section {
	components = [
		new TextDisplay("This is the main content of the section.")
	]
	accessory = new Thumbnail("https://example.com/icon.png")
}
```

## Usage Example

Here's how you might use a Section in a command:

```ts title="src/commands/section-example.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";
import { Section, TextDisplay, Thumbnail } from "@buape/carbon";

class SectionExample extends Command {
	name = "section"
	description = "Example of using a Section component"

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		const section = new Section(
			[
				new TextDisplay("This is the main text."),
				new TextDisplay("This is additional text in the same section.")
			],
			new Thumbnail("https://example.com/icon.png")
		)

		await interaction.reply({
			components: [section]
		})
	}
}
```

The Section component is particularly useful when you want to:
- Group related text and media together
- Create a consistent layout for information
- Add visual context to text content
