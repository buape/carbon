The File component is used to display references to files attached to your messages. It can show basic file information and provide access to the attached file.

## Component Structure

A File is defined by its attachment URL and an optional flag to show metadata. The URL must reference an attachment in the message using the `attachment://` protocol.

## Creating a File

To create a file component, you instantiate the `File` class with the attachment URL and optionally set showMetadata:

```ts title="src/components/file.ts"
import { File } from "@buape/carbon";

// Basic file display
const file = new File("attachment://report.pdf");

// File display with metadata
const fileWithMeta = new File("attachment://report.pdf", true);
```

## Usage Example

Here's how you might use File in a command:

```ts title="src/commands/file-example.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";
import { File, TextDisplay } from "@buape/carbon";

class FileExample extends Command {
	name = "file"
	description = "Example of using File components"

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		await interaction.reply({
			components: [
				new TextDisplay("Here's the file:"),
				new File("attachment://report.pdf", true)
			],
			files: [
				{
					name: "report.pdf",
					data: new Blob([/* file data */]),
					description: "Example PDF file"
				}
			]
		})
	}
}
```
