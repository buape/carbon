The TextDisplay component is the primary way to show text content in your messages. It's a simple but essential component that can be used standalone or within other components like Section or Container.

## Component Structure

A TextDisplay is defined by its text content. It's the most basic component type and serves as the foundation for displaying information in your messages.

## Creating a TextDisplay

To create a text display, you simply instantiate the `TextDisplay` class with your desired text:

```ts title="src/components/text.ts"
import { TextDisplay } from "@buape/carbon";

const text = new TextDisplay("Hello, world!");
```

## Usage Example

Here's how you might use TextDisplay in a command:

```ts title="src/commands/text-example.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";
import { TextDisplay, Section } from "@buape/carbon";

class TextExample extends Command {
	name = "text"
	description = "Example of using TextDisplay components"

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		const section = new Section(
			[
				new TextDisplay("This is the first line of text."),
				new TextDisplay("This is the second line of text.")
			]
		)

		await interaction.reply({
			components: [section]
		})
	}
}
```
