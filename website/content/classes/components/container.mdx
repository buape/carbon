The Container component is the foundation for organizing other components in your messages. Similar to Discord's Action Row, it serves as a wrapper that can hold multiple components and apply consistent theming.

## Component Structure

A Container is defined by its ability to hold other components and optionally apply an accent color to them. It's the primary way to group related components together in a message.

## Creating a Container

To create a container, you need to create a class that extends the `Container` class:

```ts title="src/components/container.ts"
import { Container, TextDisplay } from "@buape/carbon";

class MyContainer extends Container {
	components = [
		new TextDisplay("This text is inside a container.")
	]
	accentColor = "#5865F2" // Optional accent color
}
```

## Usage Example

Here's how you might use a Container in a command:

```ts title="src/commands/container-example.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";
import { Container, TextDisplay, Section, Thumbnail } from "@buape/carbon";

class ContainerExample extends Command {
	name = "container"
	description = "Example of using a Container component"

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		const container = new Container([
			new Section(
				[new TextDisplay("This is a section inside a container.")],
				new Thumbnail("https://example.com/icon.png")
			),
			new TextDisplay("This is standalone text in the container.")
		], "#FF0000") // Red accent color

		await interaction.reply({
			components: [container]
		})
	}
}
```
