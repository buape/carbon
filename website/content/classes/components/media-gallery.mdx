The MediaGallery component allows you to display multiple images in a gallery layout within your messages. It's useful for showcasing collections of images or related visual content.

## Component Structure

A MediaGallery is defined by its array of image items. Each item must have a URL that can point to either an external image or an attachment in the message.

## Creating a MediaGallery

To create a media gallery, you instantiate the `MediaGallery` class with an array of image items:

```ts title="src/components/gallery.ts"
import { MediaGallery } from "@buape/carbon";

const gallery = new MediaGallery([
	{ url: "attachment://photo1.jpg" },
	{ url: "https://example.com/image2.png" },
	{ url: "attachment://photo3.png" }
]);
```

## Usage Example

Here's how you might use MediaGallery in a command:

```ts title="src/commands/gallery-example.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";
import { MediaGallery, TextDisplay } from "@buape/carbon";

class GalleryExample extends Command {
	name = "gallery"
	description = "Example of using MediaGallery components"

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		await interaction.reply({
			components: [
				new TextDisplay("Here's a gallery of images:"),
				new MediaGallery([
					{ url: "attachment://photo1.jpg" },
					{ url: "https://example.com/image2.png" }
				])
			],
			files: [
				{
					name: "photo1.jpg",
					data: new Blob([/* image data */]),
					description: "First gallery image"
				}
			]
		})
	}
}
```
