Buttons appear below messages and can be used to trigger actions or link to external sources.

## Creating a Button

Subclassing the `Button` class remains the recommended approach for reusable components:

```ts title="src/buttons/ping-class.ts"
import { Button, type ButtonInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";

export default class PingButton extends Button {
	customId = "ping"
	label = "Ping"

	async run(interaction: ButtonInteraction) {
		await interaction.reply("Pong!")
	}
}
```

### Inline Button Overrides

If you only need a button in a single spot, you can instantiate it inline by extending the class on the fly:

```ts
import { Button, type ButtonInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";

const pingButton = new (class extends Button {
	customId = "ping-inline"
	label = "Ping"

	async run(interaction: ButtonInteraction) {
		await interaction.reply("Pong!")
	}
})()
```

### Setting the Style

The `style` property is used to set the style of the button. This is used to determine the style of the button. The available styles are:

-   `Primary`: A blurple colored button
-   `Secondary`: A gray colored button
-   `Success`: A green colored button
-   `Danger`: A red colored button
-   `Link`: A gray button solely used for links

## Link Buttons

Link buttons are used to link to external sources. They are typically created by extending the `LinkButton` class and providing a `url` property:

```ts title="src/buttons/link.ts"
import { LinkButton } from "@buape/carbon"

export default class DocsButton extends LinkButton {
	label = "Carbon Documentation"
	url = "https://carbon.buape.com"
}
```

Note that these buttons do not trigger any actions on the bot side, and are only used to link to external sources.
