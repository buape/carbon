The Thumbnail component is used to display small images in your messages. It's commonly used as an accessory in Section components to provide visual context alongside text content.

## Component Structure

A Thumbnail is defined by its image URL. The URL can point to an external image or reference an attachment in the message.

## Creating a Thumbnail

To create a thumbnail, you instantiate the `Thumbnail` class with the image URL:

```ts title="src/components/thumbnail.ts"
import { Thumbnail } from "@buape/carbon";

// Using a web URL
const webThumbnail = new Thumbnail("https://example.com/icon.png");

// Using an attachment
const attachedThumbnail = new Thumbnail("attachment://kiai.png");
```

## Usage Example

Here's how you might use Thumbnail in a command:

```ts title="src/commands/thumbnail-example.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";
import { Thumbnail, Section, TextDisplay } from "@buape/carbon";

class ThumbnailExample extends Command {
	name = "thumbnail"
	description = "Example of using Thumbnail components"

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		const section = new Section(
			[new TextDisplay("This text has a thumbnail next to it.")],
			new Thumbnail("https://example.com/icon.png")
		)

		await interaction.reply({
			components: [section]
		})
	}
}
```
