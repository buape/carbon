Labels are wrapper components used in [Modals](/api/classes/modals) to organize and describe form inputs. They are created by extending the `Label` class and contain a single form component such as a `TextInput` or `StringSelectMenu`.

## Creating a Label

To create a label, you need to create a class that extends the `Label` class. This class will wrap a single form component and provide descriptive text.

```ts title="src/components/name-label.ts"
import { Label, TextInput, TextInputStyle } from "@buape/carbon";

export default class NameLabel extends Label {
	label = "What is your name?"
	description = "Enter your full name"
	
	constructor() {
		super(new NameTextInput())
	}
}

class NameTextInput extends TextInput {
	customId = "name"
	style = TextInputStyle.Short
	placeholder = "Enter your name"
}
```

In this example, we have created a label that wraps a text input for collecting a user's name. The label provides both a title and description to help guide the user.

## Label Properties

### Required Properties

- `label`: The main text displayed for this section of the form
- `component`: The form component contained within this label (passed to constructor)

### Optional Properties

- `description`: Additional text that provides more context about what the user should enter
- `customId`: A unique identifier for the label (defaults to "label")

## Label with Select Menu

Labels can also contain select menus for dropdown options:

```ts title="src/components/color-label.ts"
import { Label, StringSelectMenu } from "@buape/carbon";

export default class ColorLabel extends Label {
	label = "Favorite Color"
	description = "Choose your preferred color"
	
	constructor() {
		super(new ColorSelectMenu())
	}
}

class ColorSelectMenu extends StringSelectMenu {
	customId = "color"
	placeholder = "Select a color"
	options = [
		{ label: "Red", value: "red" },
		{ label: "Blue", value: "blue" },
		{ label: "Green", value: "green" }
	]
}
```

## Usage in Modals

Labels are used as the main components in modal forms:

```ts title="src/modals/user-info.ts"
import { Modal, type ModalInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";

export default class UserInfoModal extends Modal {
	title = "User Information"
	customId = "user-info"
	
	components = [
		new NameLabel(),
		new ColorLabel()
	]
	
	async run(interaction: ModalInteraction) {
		const name = interaction.fields.getText("name")
		const color = interaction.fields.getText("color")
		await interaction.reply(`Hello ${name}, your favorite color is ${color}!`)
	}
}
```

Labels provide better organization and user experience by grouping related form elements together with clear descriptions.
