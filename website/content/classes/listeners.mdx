When you're building a Discord bot, you need to know when stuff happens - when someone sends a message, joins a server, or clicks a button. Discord sends these updates in two ways: through webhooks and through the Gateway. Let's look at how Carbon helps you handle both types easily.

## The Two Types of Events

Discord has two main ways of telling your bot what's happening:

1. **Webhook Events**: These are HTTP requests that Discord sends directly to your bot. They're great for handling things like:
	- Slash commands and component interactions
	- OAuth2 authorization grants
	- Application commands and message components
	- Premium subscription events
	These arrive as HTTP POST requests and might be slightly out of order.

2. **Gateway Events**: These come through a WebSocket connection - think of it like a constant phone line between your bot and Discord. These events:
	- Arrive in real-time with strict ordering
	- Maintain session state and resumability
	- Require specific intents to be enabled
	- Include all real-time Discord updates

The key technical differences are:
- **Delivery Mechanism**: Webhooks use HTTP POST requests, Gateway uses WebSocket frames
- **Ordering**: Gateway events are strictly ordered, webhooks may arrive out of sequence
- **Latency**: Gateway events arrive in real-time, webhooks have variable latency
- **State**: Gateway maintains session state, webhooks are stateless
- **Reliability**: Gateway includes built-in reconnection, webhooks may need manual retry logic
- **Scale**: Webhooks can scale horizontally, Gateway requires persistent connections
- **Rate Limiting**: Different rate limit rules apply to each type
- **Authentication**: Webhooks use signatures, Gateway uses token auth

## Creating Listeners in Carbon

Carbon makes it super easy to handle both types of events using the same pattern. All listeners extend from the `BaseListener` class that provides type safety and consistent interfaces:

```typescript
abstract class BaseListener {
	abstract readonly type: ListenerEventType
	abstract handle(
		data: ListenerEventData[this["type"]],
		client: Client
	): Promise<void>
}
```

Let's look at some examples:

### Handling Bot Installation

Want to do something when someone adds your bot to their server? Here's how:

```typescript title="src/events/authorized.ts"
import { 
	ListenerEvent,
	type Client,
	ApplicationAuthorizedListener,
	type ListenerEventData,
	ApplicationIntegrationType
} from "@buape/carbon"

export class ApplicationAuthorized extends ApplicationAuthorizedListener {
	async handle(
		data: ListenerEventData[typeof ListenerEvent.ApplicationAuthorized],
		client: Client
	) {
		if (data.integration_type === ApplicationIntegrationType.GuildInstall) {
			console.log(`Bot was added to ${data.guild?.name}`)
			// Maybe set up some initial server settings here
			
			// Example: Send welcome message

		} else {
			console.log(`${data.user.username} authorized the app`)
			// Handle other authorization types
		}
	}
}
```

### Handling Gateway Events

Gateway events are where the fun stuff happens. Here are a couple of common examples:

#### When Your Bot Starts Up

```typescript title="src/events/ready.ts"
import { 
	ListenerEvent,
	type Client,
	ReadyListener,
	type ListenerEventData 
} from "@buape/carbon"

export class Ready extends ReadyListener {
	async handle(
		data: ListenerEventData[typeof ListenerEvent.Ready],
		client: Client
	) {
		console.log(`Ready! Logged in as ${data.user.username}`)
		console.log(`Serving ${data.guilds.length} servers`)
		
		// Set up any initialization tasks here
		await registerCommands(client);
		await setupPeriodicTasks(client);
	}
}
```

#### Handling Messages

Want to do something when people send messages? Here's how:

```typescript title="src/events/messageCreate.ts"
import { 
	ListenerEvent,
	type Client,
	MessageCreateListener,
	type ListenerEventData 
} from "@buape/carbon"

export class MessageCreate extends MessageCreateListener {
	async handle(
		data: ListenerEventData[typeof ListenerEvent.MessageCreate],
		client: Client
	) {
		// Don't respond to other bots!
		if (data.author.bot) return;

		const { content, author, guild } = data;
		
		if (guild && content) {
			// Handle the message in a guild context
			console.log(`${author.username} said: ${content} in ${guild.name}`);
			
			// Example: Command handling
			if (content.startsWith('!')) {
				const [command, ...args] = content.slice(1).split(' ');
				await handleCommand(command, args, data, client);
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Adding Your Listeners

Once you've created your listeners, you need to tell Carbon about them. Just add them to your client setup:

```typescript title="src/index.ts"
import { Client } from "@buape/carbon"
import { Ready } from "./events/ready"
import { MessageCreate } from "./events/messageCreate"
import { ApplicationAuthorized } from "./events/authorized"

const client = new Client(
	{
		baseUrl: process.env.BASE_URL,
		deploySecret: process.env.DEPLOY_SECRET,
		clientId: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
		publicKey: process.env.DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY,
		token: process.env.DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
	},
	{
		commands: [], // Your slash commands go here
		listeners: [
			new Ready(),
			new MessageCreate(),
			new ApplicationAuthorized()
		]
	}
)
```

## Events You Can Listen For

Carbon supports all of Discord's events. Here are some of the most common ones:

### Gateway Events
- Server events: `GuildCreate`, `GuildDelete`, `GuildUpdate`
- Member events: `GuildMemberAdd`, `GuildMemberRemove`, `GuildMemberUpdate`
- Message events: `MessageCreate`, `MessageUpdate`, `MessageDelete`
- Channel events: `ChannelCreate`, `ChannelUpdate`, `ChannelDelete`
- Voice events: `VoiceStateUpdate`, `VoiceServerUpdate`
- Interaction events: `InteractionCreate`

### Webhook Events
- Application events: `ApplicationAuthorized`
- Premium events: `EntitlementCreate`, `EntitlementUpdate`, `EntitlementDelete`
- Quest events: `QuestUserEnrollment`

Each event type comes with its own data structure defined in the `ListenerEventData` type, which provides full type safety and autocompletion in your IDE. The event data includes everything you need to know about what happened, properly typed and easily accessible.
