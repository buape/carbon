In addition to the regular interactions system, Discord also provides a way to trigger events in your application. 
Webhook events are one-way events sent to your app over HTTP to notify you when an event occurs. 
Unlike events that are sent over Gateway connections, events sent over webhooks are not realtime or guaranteed to be in order.

In Carbon, we use Listeners to handle events from Discord. These events can include things like application authorization changes or entitlement updates.

## Creating a Listener

To create a listener, extend the `Listener` class and implement the required methods:

```ts title="src/listeners/AuthorizationListener"
import {
	ApplicationIntegrationType,
	ApplicationWebhookEventType,
	type Client,
	Listener,
	type ListenerEventData
} from "@buape/carbon"

export class ApplicationAuthorizedListener extends Listener {
	type = ApplicationWebhookEventType.ApplicationAuthorized
	override async handle(
		data: ListenerEventData<ApplicationWebhookEventType.ApplicationAuthorized>,
		client: Client
	) {
		if (data.integration_type === ApplicationIntegrationType.GuildInstall) {
			client.log(`Added to server ${data.guild?.name} (${data.guild?.id})`)
		} else {
			client.log(`Added to user ${data.user.username} (${data.user.id})`)
		}
	}
}
```

## Registering Listeners


Listeners need to be registered with your Carbon client when initializing it:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { Client } from "carbon"
import { AuthorizationListener } from "./listeners/AuthorizationListener"

const client = new Client({
  // ... other options
}, {
	commands: [],
	listeners: [
		new AuthorizationListener()
	]
})
```
