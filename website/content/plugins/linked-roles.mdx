## Usage

Linked Roles are straightforward to use in Carbon, simplify create an instance and pass it to the plugins array in your `Client` constructor.

You can only have five metadata per application, and they apply across all guilds your app is in.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add a Linked Roles Instance

To add Linked Roles to your bot, you'll need to create a new instance of the `LinkedRoles` class and pass it some metadata. The metadata is an array of objects that define the criteria for each role. In this example, we're creating a role that can only be claimed by users who have the `is_staff` metadata set to `true`.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { Client, ApplicationRoleConnectionMetadataType } from "@buape/carbon"
import { LinkedRoles } from "@buape/carbon/linked-roles"

const linkedRoles = new LinkedRoles({
  metadata: [
	{
	  key: 'is_staff',
	  name: 'Verified Staff',
	  description: 'Whether the user is a verified staff member',
	  type: ApplicationRoleConnectionMetadataType.BooleanEqual
	}
  ],
  metadataCheckers: {
	is_staff: async (userId) => {
	  // Check if the user is a staff member
	  return true
	}
  }
})

const client = new Client({ ... }, [ ... ], [linkedRoles])
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Portal URLs

Just like with interactions, you'll need to configure some URLs in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to handle Linked Roles. Firstly, set "Linked Roles Verification URL" to `<BASE_URL>/linked-roles/verify-user` and add a OAuth2 redirect URL of `<BASE_URL>/linked-roles/verify-user/callback`.
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Your Metadata to Discord

Finally, to deploy your linked roles metadata to Discord, navigate to `<BASE_URL>/linked-roles/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>` in your browser. This will send your metadata to Discord, where it will be used to create the roles.
