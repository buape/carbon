Linked Roles are a handy feature of Discord that allows you to create roles that users have to meet certain criteria in order to claim those roles.

## Usage

Linked Roles are straightforward to use in Carbon, simplify create an instance and pass it to the plugins array in your `createHandle` function factory.

You can only have five metadata per application, and they apply across all guilds your app is in.

### Add a Linked Roles Instance

To add Linked Roles to your bot, you'll need to create a new instance of the `LinkedRoles` class and pass it your client and some metadata. The metadata is an array of objects that define the criteria for each role. In this example, we're creating a role that can only be claimed by users who have the `is_staff` metadata set to `true`.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { createHandle, Client, ApplicationRoleConnectionMetadataType } from "@buape/carbon"
import { LinkedRoles } from "@buape/carbon/linked-roles"

const handle = createHandle((env) => {
    const client = new Client({ ... }, [ ... ])
    const linkedRoles = new LinkedRoles(client, {
        metadata: [
            {
                key: 'is_staff',
                name: 'Verified Staff',
                description: 'Whether the user is a verified staff member',
                type: ApplicationRoleConnectionMetadataType.BooleanEqual
            }
        ],
	    metadataCheckers: {
		    is_staff: async (userId) => {
                const allStaff = ["439223656200273932"]
                return allStaff.includes(userId)
		    }
	    }
    })
    return [client, linkedRoles]
})
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Portal URLs

Just like with interactions, you'll need to configure some URLs in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to handle Linked Roles. Firstly, set "Linked Roles Verification URL" to `<BASE_URL>/linked-roles/verify-user` and add a OAuth2 redirect URL of `<BASE_URL>/linked-roles/verify-user/callback`.
</Step>

<Step>
### Deploy Your Metadata to Discord

Finally, to deploy your linked roles metadata to Discord, navigate to `<BASE_URL>/linked-roles/deploy?secret=<DEPLOY_SECRET>` in your browser. This will send your metadata to Discord, where it will be used to create the roles.
