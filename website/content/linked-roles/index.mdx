Linked Roles are a handy feature of Discord that allows you to create roles that users have to meet certain criteria in order to claim those roles.

[You can read more about the feature from an admin standpoint here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10388356626711-Connections-Linked-Roles-Admins), or [from a user standpoint here.](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823-Connections-Linked-Roles-Community-Members).
