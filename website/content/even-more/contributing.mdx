First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. You can see below for different ways to help and details about how Carbon handles them. Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved.

And if you like Carbon, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy ways to support Carbon and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:

-   Star us on GitHub
-   [Sponsor us](https://github.com/sponsors/buape)
-   Refer this project in your project's readme
-   Tell others about us!

## Contributing Guidelines

-   All contributions must be made in the form of a pull request.
-   All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer before they can be merged.
-   All pull requests must be made to the `main` branch.
-   All pull requests must pass the CI checks.
-   All pull requests must have a clear and concise description of the changes made, and how they have been tested.

We prefer that all PRs also have an associated issue, so that we can track the progress of the PR and keep the discussion focused on the issue at hand.
