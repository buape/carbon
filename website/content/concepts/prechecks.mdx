Prechecks are a powerful feature in Carbon that allow you to add additional validation and checks before a command is executed. This can be useful for implementing features like cooldowns, permission checks, or any other validation that needs to happen before the main command logic runs.

## How Prechecks Work

Prechecks are implemented by overriding the `preCheck` method in your command class. This method is called before the main `run` method of your command. If the precheck returns anything other than `true`, the command will not execute.

Here's a basic example of a precheck:

```typescript
import { Command } from "@buape/carbon"
import { CommandInteraction } from "discord.js"

export default class MyCommand extends Command {
	public override async preCheck(interaction: CommandInteraction): Promise<true | unknown> {
		// Check if the user has a specific role
		if (!interaction.member?.roles.cache.has("123456789")) {
			await interaction.reply("You don't have permission to use this command!")
			return false
		}
		return true
	}

	public override async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		// Your command logic here
	}
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### Cooldowns
You can implement cooldowns using prechecks to prevent users from spamming commands:

```typescript
private cooldowns = new Map<string, number>()

public override async preCheck(interaction: CommandInteraction): Promise<true | unknown> {
	const cooldown = 5000 // 5 seconds
	const now = Date.now()
	const lastUsed = this.cooldowns.get(interaction.user.id)

	if (lastUsed && now - lastUsed < cooldown) {
		await interaction.reply(`Please wait ${Math.ceil((cooldown - (now - lastUsed)) / 1000)} seconds before using this command again.`)
		return false
	}

	this.cooldowns.set(interaction.user.id, now)
	return true
}
```

### Permission Checks
You can use prechecks to verify if a user has the necessary permissions to use a command:

```typescript
public override async preCheck(interaction: CommandInteraction): Promise<true | unknown> {
	if (!interaction.memberPermissions?.has("Administrator")) {
		await interaction.reply("You need administrator permissions to use this command!")
		return false
	}
	return true
}
```

### Maintenance Mode
You can implement a maintenance mode that prevents commands from being used:

```typescript
private maintenanceMode = false

public override async preCheck(interaction: CommandInteraction): Promise<true | unknown> {
	if (this.maintenanceMode) {
		await interaction.reply("This command is currently under maintenance. Please try again later.")
		return false
	}
	return true
}
```
