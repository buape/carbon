## Automatic Setup

We recommend starting a new Carbon project using [`create-carbon`](https://npmjs.com/package/create-carbon), which will set everything up automatically for you. To create a project, run:

<PackageManager.Run executor scripts={["create-carbon@latest"]} />

You'll be prompted to enter a project name, select a runtime, and configure some other options. Once you've answered all the questions, `create-carbon` will generate a new project for you.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up a Carbon project manually, follow the steps below:

import { Steps, Step } from "fumadocs-ui/components/steps";

<Steps>

<Step>
### Set Up a TypeScript Project

First, set up a new TypeScript project. You can follow the official [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) for detailed instructions on how to get started.

</Step>

<Step>
### Install the Package

Let's start by adding Carbon to your project:

<PackageManager.Install packages={["@buape/carbon"]} />
</Step>

<Step>
### Create a Client

Next, create a new client instance by importing the `Client` class from the `@buape/carbon` package. The client requires a configuration object with your bot's credentials and an array of commands to register.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { Client } from "@buape/carbon";

const client = new Client({
	baseUrl: process.env.BASE_URL,
	deploySecret: process.env.DEPLOY_SECRET,
	clientId: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID,
	publicKey: process.env.DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY,
	token: process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN,
}, [])
```

<Callout type="info">
The `deploySecret` is your own secret key used to verify requests to protected endpoints, such as the deploy commands endpoint, an endpoint that you do not want to be spammed.
Setting environment variables will be covered in a later step.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Create a Command

Now we'll create a simple command that responds with "Hello!" when invoked. This command will serve as a basic example to demonstrate how to set up and handle interactions with your bot.

```ts title="src/commands/hello.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";

export default class HelloCommand extends Command {
	name = "hello";
	description = "Say hello to the bot";

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		await interaction.reply("Hello!");
	}
}
```

Then, mount the command to your client to make it available for use. This step involves importing the command and adding it to the client's configuration.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import HelloCommand from './commands/hello'

const client = new Client(
	{ ... },
	[new HelloCommand()]
)
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Use an Adapter

You'll now need to set up an adapter to wrap your handle function to work with your runtime, pick an adapter from the list below to continue.
