## Automatic Setup

We recommend starting a new Carbon project using [`create-carbon`](https://npmjs.com/package/create-carbon), which will set everything up automatically for you. To create a project, run:

<PackageManager.Run executor scripts={["create-carbon@latest"]} />

You'll be prompted to enter a project name, select a runtime, and configure some other options. Once you've answered all the questions, `create-carbon` will generate a new project for you.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up a Carbon project manually, follow the steps below:

import { Steps, Step } from "fumadocs-ui/components/steps";

<Steps>

<Step>
### Set Up a TypeScript Project

First, set up a new TypeScript project. You can follow the official [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) for detailed instructions on how to get started.

</Step>

<Step>
### Install the Package

Let's start by adding Carbon to your project:

<PackageManager.Install packages={["@buape/carbon"]} />
</Step>

<Step>
### Create a Client and Handle Function

Next, create a handle function by passing a client factory to the [`createHandle`](/api/functions/createhandle) function. The factory should return an array of plugins, the first being the client, and the rest being any other optional plugins you may want to add.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { createHandle, Client } from "@buape/carbon";

const handle = createHandle((env) => {
    const client = new Client(
        {
            baseUrl: String(env.BASE_URL),
            clientId: String(env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID),
            clientSecret: String(env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET),
            publicKey: String(env.DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY),
            token: String(env.DISCORD_TOKEN),
        },
        []
    )
    return [client];
});
```

    Setting environment variables will be covered in a later step.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Create a Command

Now we'll create a simple command that responds with "Hello!" when invoked. This command will serve as a basic example to demonstrate how to set up and handle interactions with your bot.

```ts title="src/commands/hello.ts"
import { Command, type CommandInteraction } from "@buape/carbon";

export default class HelloCommand extends Command {
    name = "hello";
    description = "Say hello to the bot";

    async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
        await interaction.reply("Hello!");
    }
}
```

Then, mount the command to your client to make it available for use. This step involves importing the command and adding it to the client's configuration.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import HelloCommand from './commands/hello'

const handle = createHandle((env) => {
    const client = new Client(
        { ... },
        [HelloCommand]
    )
    return [client]
})
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Use an Adapter

You'll now need to set up an adapter to wrap your handle function to work with your runtime, pick an adapter from the list below to continue.
