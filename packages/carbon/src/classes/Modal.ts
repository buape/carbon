	 * This function is called by the handler when a component is received, and is used to parse the custom ID into a key and data object.

	 * It will also automatically parse `true` and `false` as booleans, and will parse numbers as numbers.
	 *
	 * You can override this to parse the ID in a different format as you see fit, but it must follow these rules:
	 * - The ID must have a `key` somewhere in the ID that can be returned by the parser. This key is what Carbon's component handler will use to identify the component and pass an interaction to the correct component.
	 * - The data must be able to be arbitrary as far as Carbon's handler is concerned, meaning that any component with the same base key can be treated as the same component with logic within the component's logic methods to handle the data.
	 *

	 * @returns The base key and the data object
