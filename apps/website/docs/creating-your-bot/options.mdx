Now, let's learn how to use options in a Component.

Create another file in your `components` folder called `favorite.js`.

We are going to make a basic command that allows users to list one or more of their favorite things, and then we will display that in a list.

## Create the Component

First, let's create the Component.

```js
export default class Options extends Command {
	name = "options"
	description = "Options test"
	defer = true

	options: APIApplicationCommandBasicOption[] = [
		{
			name: "str",
			type: ApplicationCommandOptionType.String,
			description: "DESCRIPTION",
			required: true
		}
	]

	async run(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
		interaction.reply({
			content: `${interaction.options.str}`
		})
	}
}

```
{/* 
Now, we need to add the options to it. Add this below the description in the constructor:

```js
options: [
	{
		name: "color",
		description: "What is your favorite color?",
		type: "string",
		required: true
	},
	{
		name: "food",
		description: "What is your favorite food?",
		type: "string"
	},
	{
		name: "animal",
		description: "What is your favorite animal?",
		type: "string"
	}
]
```

This will add three options to the command, "color", "food", and "animal". Since we are using the DiscordInteractionModule, these will be automatically added to the slash command in Discord.

Different modules will parse these differently, so check the documentation for the module you are using.

The DiscordMessageModule and GuildedModule allow options to be used by writing them like this in the command:

```
!favorite --animal Mountain Lion --color Red --food Pizza
```

:::

## Using the Options

Now, let's use the options in the command. Add your run function

```js
public override async run(interaction, options) {

}
```

Now, instead of just sending back a "Pong" reply, let's get the options that we specified. Since we set the types of the options to "string", we can use the `getString` method to get the value of the option.

```js
public override async run(interaction, options) {
	const color = options.getString("color")
	const food = options.getString("food")
	const animal = options.getString("animal")
}
```

Now, let's send a reply with the options. To do this, we will create an empty string as our message.

```js
public override async run(interaction, options) {
	const color = options.getString("color")
	const food = options.getString("food")
	const animal = options.getString("animal")

	let message = ""
}
```

If you look back on the code when we set the options, you will notice that we did not set any of the options as `required`. This means that the user can choose to not set any of the options, so we need to check if they are defined before we add them to the message.

Let's go through each option and add it to the message only if it is defined.

We can use the `+=` operator on the string to add a new string to the end of the string already defined in the variable, then we put `\n` on the end to add a new line.

```js
public override async run(interaction, options) {
	const color = options.getString("color")
	const food = options.getString("food")
	const animal = options.getString("animal")

	let message = ""

	if(color) message += `Your favorite color is ${color}.\n`
	if(food) message += `Your favorite food is ${food}.\n`
	if(animal) message += `Your favorite animal is ${animal}.\n`
}
```

Finally, we need to send the message back to the user. We can do this with the `reply` method on the interaction.

```js
public override async run(interaction, options) {
	const color = options.getString("color")
	const food = options.getString("food")
	const animal = options.getString("animal")

	let message = ""

	if(color) message += `Your favorite color is ${color}.\n`
	if(food) message += `Your favorite food is ${food}.\n`
	if(animal) message += `Your favorite animal is ${animal}.\n`

	await interaction.reply(message)
}
```

And that's it! You can now use options in your commands. */}
